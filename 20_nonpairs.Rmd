## Filler

A compound object is a set of $m>1$ objects. This chapter treats the
analysis of dissimilarities between compound objects, again as far as they fit into the smacof framework. Thus we do not, for example, look at the
pairwise dissimilarities within a triad of objects, but at the dissimilarities of the triads themselves.
