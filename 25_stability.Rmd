## How Large is My Stress ?

Users of MDS, influenced no doubt by the tyranny of significance tests, often ask if their
stress level from a smacof analysis is low or high. The appropriate answer, in many cases, is:
"It's as low as I could get it."

Kruskal has muddied the waters.

Normalization. Remember

$$
\sigma(X)=\frac{\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}(\delta_{ij}-d_{ij}(X))^2}{\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}^2}
$$
so it is the weighted average of the squared residuals, relative to the weighted 
average of the squared dissimilarities. If we take the square root then weighted
averages of squares become root-mean-squares.

$$
\mathbb{E}(\chi_p)=\sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{p+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{p}{2})}
